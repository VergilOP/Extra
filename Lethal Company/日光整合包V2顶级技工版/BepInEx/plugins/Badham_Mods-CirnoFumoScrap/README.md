# Cirno Fumo Scrap

## Features:
Adds the funny little ice fairy as findable scrap in all levels. Comes with a basic config to adjust how rare they are.
Includes model and SFX. Each fumo's base value is 100-150 scrap, adjusted by level difficulty (i.e. in starter moons the price is 40-60)


This mod requires everyone in the lobby to have it installed to avoid desync; the server only respects the configuration of the host so the config doesn't need to match (At least as far as I can tell; if there's issues, try making them match)


I might add the Deka Cirno Fumo as a 2-handed scrap as well in a later version.

## How to Install:
- Make sure you have [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) & [LethalLib](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Evaisa/LethalLib/) installed.
- Download and unzip the mod.
- Merge the BepInEx folder from this zip with the one found at: (`\GAME_LOCATION\Lethal Company\BepInEx`)
- Optional: Launch and close the game to generate config file.
