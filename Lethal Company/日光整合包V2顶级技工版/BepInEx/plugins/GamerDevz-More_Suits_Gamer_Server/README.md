# More Suits - Gamer Server
### Adds custom suits for the More Suits mod.

## Instructions
Place the ```More_Suits-Gamer Server``` folder in your ```BepInEx/Plugins``` folder. 

## Reminder for adding more suits
Upload your own package with a ```moresuits``` folder in it (do not include the MoreSuits.dll file) and add ```x753-More_Suits-1.3.0``` as a dependency, and this mod will automatically load your .png files as suits. If you don't want the suits that originally come with my mod, add a file called ```!less-suits.txt``` to your ```moresuits``` folder in your mod, or adjust the config file ```BepInEx\config\x753.More_Suits.cfg```.
