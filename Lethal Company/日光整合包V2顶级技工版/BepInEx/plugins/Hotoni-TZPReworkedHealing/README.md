**<h1>TZP Reworked: Portable healing</h1>**

<h3>The TZP Inhaler now heals you over time up to 200% of your total HP.</h3>	
It will also display the fuel left like a battery and your current health status on the interface when you're using the inhaler.
<h4>This mod is client side so every player needs it locally. Tested and working in multiplayer.</h4>	


Roadmap
---
Adjust the vanilla settings to that the tool is more cost effective with the added bonus.
Infinite TZP can also be enabled in the config (Disabled by default)

Current issues
---
When critically wounded (<10% hp) the critical hit sound loops a little when healing, it's not too bad and only hearable by the player using it.
You can do the charge animation (it won't charge but cannot be disabled right now)
